Ingredients:
 - 1/4 cup melted butter (50 g)
 - 1/4 cup sugar (50 g)
 - 1/2 cup flour (50 g)
 - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1 egg
 - 2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
 1. In a medium bowl, melt your butter. Then add in the sugar and whisk until     well combined. Add in the baking powder, flour, eggs, and milk and whisk like     mad. You want the mixture to be smooth and creamy.
 
 2. Spray your ramekins with cooking spray, and then fill them a little over     halfway. Tap the ramekins on the counter to knock out any air bubbles. Cover     them with a piece of saran wrap, leaving a small part of the edge unsealed so     steam can escape.
 
 3. Cook in the microwave for 50-60 seconds. (At home, it took me 60 seconds. In     the test kitchen, 55 seconds gave me a good result.) Too little time, and the     cake will be wet on the outside. Too much time, and it will become really     crumbly. Also, cooking them individually is best. Once it's cooked, take off     the plastic wrap and pop the cake out onto a plate. It should come out fairly     easily, but if it needs a little help you can run a butter knife around the     edges.
